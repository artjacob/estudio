<h1>Runnin' Down a Dream</h1>

Tom: <em>D</em>

         <em>E</em>
It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down
          <em>D</em>                   <em>E</em>
I had the radio on. I was drivin'
                                             <em>D</em>
Trees flew by, me and Del was singin' little runaway
      <em>E</em>
I was flyin'

(refrão)
         <em>A</em>       <em>G</em>      <em>E</em>
Yeah I'm runnin' down a dream
     <em>E</em>           <em>G</em>       <em>A</em>
That never would come to me
<em>A</em>            <em>G</em>    <em>E</em>   <em>E</em>          <em>G</em>      <em>A</em>
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
<em>A</em>       <em>G</em>      <em>E</em>
Runnin' down a dream

I felt so good like anything was possible
I hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes
The last tree days the rain was un-stoppable
It was always cold, no sunshine

(refrão)

I rolled on as the sky grew dark
I put the pedal down to make some time
There's something good waitin' down this road
I'm pickin' up whatever's mine

(refrão)
